# Flower project
This is the flower project where you can run federated learning using the flower framework. 

## Running
To run the sample start the `server.py` once and `worker.py` twice to run the test, using the flower configuration specified in the launch.json. 
### Generating the venv
The repository is set up in such a way that the flower venv is expected at the root of the flower folder and is named flower. Initialize a venv and call it flower, and import the requirements from `requirements.txt`.
